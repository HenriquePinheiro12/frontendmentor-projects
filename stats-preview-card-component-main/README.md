## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

With this basic project I could practice some structure building tools, just as CSS flexbox and HTML semantic tags.
An important thing I could practice - I guess for the first time - were some pseudo classes in CSS, just like the following example, which refers the first li child of the parent ul:

```html
<ul>
  <li>Lorem</li>
  <li>Lorem</li>
</ul>
```

```css
ul li{
    margin: 0 1.8rem;
}

ul li:first-child{
    margin-left: 0;
}
```

### Continued development

Shall study about CSS pseudo classes and pseudo elements in the future.
